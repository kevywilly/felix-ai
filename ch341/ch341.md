## **Detailed Steps**

### **1. Check for Existing Modules**

Before proceeding, check if the CH340 and CP210x drivers are already installed.

**a. Check Loaded Modules:**

```bash
lsmod | grep -E 'ch341|cp210x|usbserial'
```

If `ch341`, `cp210x`, or `usbserial` appear in the output, the drivers are already loaded.

**b. Check Available Modules:**

```bash
find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*.ko' | grep -E 'ch341|cp210x'
```

If the modules are found, you can load them:

```bash
sudo modprobe ch341
sudo modprobe cp210x
```

If the modules are not found, proceed to the next steps to build and install them.

---

### **2. Install Necessary Build Tools**

You need to install build tools and dependencies to compile kernel modules.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential bc git libncurses5-dev flex bison
```

---

### **3. Download and Prepare Kernel Sources**

**a. Determine Kernel Version and L4T Release:**

- Find your kernel version:

  ```bash
  uname -r
  ```

- Check L4T (Linux for Tegra) version:

  ```bash
  head -n 1 /etc/nv_tegra_release
  ```

**b. Download Kernel Sources:**

- Go to the NVIDIA Jetson Download Center: [Jetson Download Center](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).

- Locate the **Sources for Jetson Orin Nano** corresponding to your L4T release.

- Download the **Public Sources (kernel sources)** tarball, typically named similar to `public_sources.tbz2`.

**c. Prepare the Sources:**

```bash
mkdir ~/jetson_kernel
cd ~/jetson_kernel
```

- Copy the downloaded `public_sources.tbz2` into this directory.

- Extract the tarball:

  ```bash
  tar -xvf public_sources.tbz2
  ```

- Navigate to the kernel source directory:

  ```bash
  cd Linux_for_Tegra/source/public
  tar -xvf kernel_src.tbz2
  cd kernel/kernel-5.10
  ```

**Note:** The kernel version may vary (e.g., `kernel-5.10`) based on your L4T version.

---

### **4. Configure the Kernel**

**a. Copy Current Kernel Config:**

Extract your current kernel configuration:

```bash
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
```

**b. Open Configuration Menu:**

```bash
make menuconfig
```

A terminal-based menu will appear.

**c. Enable USB Serial Drivers:**

- Navigate through the menus:

  - **Device Drivers** → **USB support** → **USB Serial Converter support**

- Enable the following options:

  - **USB Serial Converter support** (`CONFIG_USB_SERIAL`):
    - Set as module (recommended): `[M]`
  - **USB CP210x family of USB to serial converters** (`CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_CP210X`):
    - Set as module: `[M]`
  - **USB Winchiphead CH341 Single Port Serial Driver** (`CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_CH341`):
    - Set as module: `[M]`

To set an option as a module, highlight it and press `M`.

**d. Save Configuration:**

- Press **Exit** until prompted to save the configuration.
- Select **Yes** to save.

---

### **5. Build and Install Modules**

**a. Set Kernel Version Variable:**

It's important the modules are built for the exact kernel version.

```bash
export LOCALVERSION="-tegra"
```

**b. Build Modules:**

```bash
make prepare
make modules_prepare
make -j$(nproc) modules
```

This compiles the modules you enabled.

**c. Install Modules:**

```bash
sudo make modules_install
```

This installs the modules into `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/`.

**d. Update Module Dependencies:**

```bash
sudo depmod -a
```

---

### **6. Load the Modules**

**a. Manually Load Modules:**

```bash
sudo modprobe ch341
sudo modprobe cp210x
```

**b. Verify Modules are Loaded:**

```bash
lsmod | grep -E 'ch341|cp210x'
```

---

### **7. Set Up Automatic Module Loading**

To ensure the modules load automatically at boot:

**a. Add Modules to `/etc/modules`:**

```bash
echo -e "ch341\ncp210x" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

**b. Create Module Configuration Files (Optional):**

Create a configuration file for each module in `/etc/modprobe.d/` if needed.

---

### **8. Verify Device Recognition**

**a. Reconnect Your Device:**

Unplug and replug your USB device.

**b. Check System Messages:**

```bash
dmesg | grep -E 'ch341|cp210x|ttyUSB'
```

You should see messages indicating that a new USB serial device has been connected and assigned (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).

**c. List Serial Devices:**

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

**d. Verify Device with `lsusb`:**

```bash
lsusb
```

Look for entries corresponding to your CH340 or CP210x device.

---

### **9. Adjust User Permissions**

To access serial devices as a non-root user:

**a. Add User to `dialout` Group:**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

**b. Log Out and Log Back In:**

This ensures group membership changes take effect.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue:** Modules fail to build or install.

- **Solution:** Ensure all build dependencies are installed. Double-check that you are using the correct kernel sources matching your running kernel.

**Issue:** Modules are loaded but the device is still not recognized.

- **Solution:** Verify that the device is not faulty by testing it on another system. Check for typos or misconfigurations in your kernel build.

**Issue:** Permission denied when accessing `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

- **Solution:** Ensure you've added your user to the `dialout` group and logged back in.

## **Summary**

By following these steps, you should be able to enable CH340 and CP210x support on your Jetson Orin Nano, allowing it to communicate with devices like the Yahboom ROS robot expansion board. Once the drivers are installed and loaded, your system should recognize the expansion board when connected via USB, and you can proceed with configuring ROS and other software as per Yahboom's instructions.
